              <p>How might we make it easier for people to streamline their daily activities?</p>
                <br>
                <p>Introverts often want de-cluttered timetables, so they could have greater control over scheduling me-time. 
                <b>Weekbox</b> is designed to support introverts' practices but also allows extroverts to experience the benefits of designing for the introverts. 
                With the <b>"time-boxing"</b> method in the core Weekbox will help users to schedule their week better and easier. 
                In this project we designed a physio-digital calendar, to make time management more tangible and convinient. 
                Often, time for self-revolving activities, me-time, are forgotten in the planning. 
                We wanted to change this and make the users be able to better sense of how they spend their time.</p>

                            <br>
                            The aim with the physical prototype is to help students get a
                            better sense of how they spend their time.
                            The boxes are thought to make users reflect on time in a new
                            way - and that the physical interaction will make time more
                            tangible.
                            Built on the idea of time boxing: a time management method
                            of allocating a fixed time within which a specific task should be
                            completed to optimize productivity. 
                            The physical prototype consists of several magnetic boxes
                            representing 1-2 hours slots that can be placed in your
                            scheduling box. The different colors represent different activities
                            such as work, me-time, and school.

                    <h2>METHOD: DISCOVER, DEFINE, DEVELOP, DELIVER</h2>
                    <p>We applied a double-diamond framework for the designing of the prototypes, 
                        with feedback interation in-between each stage.
                        <br><br>DISCOVER
                        <br>
                        In order to narrow down the design brief, we started brainstorming about our
                        personal experiences with the pandemic and researched about both empirical
                        and psychological meaning of introverts alongside with their practices. Based
                        on the resources we found, we chose to broadly focus on students from KTH.
                        We then developed a <b>pre user survey</b> to get general insights from the user
                        group before narrowing it down.
                        <br>
                        The pre user survey consisted of checkboxes where
                        students could choose which matters were the most
                        pressing, and write short comments about their
                        answers. 
                        20 KTH students participated in the survey, and
                        80% of them answered to be introverts. The results
                        revealed the problems that students have with time
                        management in hybrid study situation and also
                        helped define introverts and extroverts, which was
                        a main part in interpreting the design brief.
                        <br>
                        We further developed more qualitative user interview questions that would deeply
                        explore KTH students’ daily lives and time management situations. A total of eight
                        interviews were conducted with potential users. Through the interviews, we got detailed
                        insights in what problems students face during day-to-day planning and time
                        management.

                        <br>
                        Once the interviews were conducted, we used an affinity diagram to group common problems togethers, get an organized insight, and find key issues.

                                fourth year at KTH. The classes at KTH are quite
                                hectic with many group projects but in her freetime she likes to exercise, hang out with friends
                                and call her parents who live in another city. Mia
                                lives 50 minutes away from Campus and her
                                studies are currently hybrid but she tries to go
                                campus as often as possible to work on group
                                projects and attend lectures. Mia plan her
                                schedule on a weekly basis and make-to-do lists
                                to keep track of deadlines, but still feel that it is

                                hobbies etc. She defines herself as an introvert
                                and really values calm moments at home after

                            What problem are we trying to solve?<br>
                                Improving lives of students at KTH.<br><br>
                            1. Design question<br>
                                How can we support and encourage introvert practices, provide simplicity, and structure time management?<br><br>
                            2. State ultimate impact<br>
                                We want to support students in managing their hectic schedules.<br><br>
                            3. Possible solutions<br>
                                A better method for organizing different activities, making the scheduling of group activities easier, using time blocking
                                method, making sure that students have a good life balance.<br><br>
                            4. Context and constraints<br>
                                Commuting time, finding a quiet place to do online meetings, difficult to find time and places for meetings.<br><br>
                            5. Tweak design question<br>
                                Problem statement: Introverts often want de cluttered timetables so they could have greater control
                                over scheduling me-time.<br>
                                <br><br>
                            > How might we make it easier for people to
                            streamline their daily activities?

                          <br>
                            As an initial step for developing the product,
                            each member started by brainstorming ideas
                            on their own. The ideas were sketched on
                            seperate post-it notes, which were later
                            discussed with the group.
                            <br><br>
                            When a general idea of the product had
                            been agreed upon, the members sketched a
                            more detailed version, presenting their
                            interpretation of the problem.
                            <br><br>
                            We defined the funcions of the products more concretely
                            by listing potential functions that could be interpreted
                            through what we discovered so far, and then highlighted
                            the most valuable functions to design. 
                            <br>
                            This step provided a set idea for the product, which
                            explained what functions the product should have.
                            <br><br>
                            The initial idea was materialized with wireframes and
                            simple materials. After creating the lo-fi prototypes,
                            we evaluated the usability by observing users
                            conducting the tasks we provided. This allowed us to
                            see what functionalities were useful, could be added
                            or improved and which were redundant. 
                            <br><br>
                            Based on the lo-fi prototypes and the following evaluation, we
                            created a hi-fi digital prototype and a mid-fi physical prototype.
                            The protoypes were evalutated by giving users 8 differents tasks
                            to perform. 
                            <br>
                            By observing how the users behaved, performed on the tasks and
                            listening to the their feedback we found important insights in how
                            the prototypes could be improved for the final deliverable.
