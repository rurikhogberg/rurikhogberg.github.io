              <p>Welcome to <i>On the Same Page</i> — an exploration of literature reimagined. 
                In a world saturated with choices, selecting a book can feel less like a simple task and more like navigating an overwhelming stream of options. 
                This project invites you into a space where discovery feels intuitive — a blend of design and technology working seamlessly to surface stories worth exploring.
                 Here, books aren’t just listed; they’re visualized — each one a data point on a filterable scatterplot, dynamically positioned and ready to be uncovered. 
                As you move through this digital landscape, book covers and key details emerge, turning abstract data into a meaningful, interactive experience.</p>
              <h2>Purposeful Data Visualization</h2>
              <br>
              <p>The foundation of <i>On the Same Page</i> lies in its user-ranked data, sourced from Goodreads, a platform known for its vast literary collection. 
                With millions of titles to choose from, this project hones in on the extraordinary — the top one thousand books ever, as ranked by the Goodreads community. 
                This refined selection drives the visualization, offering users a focused yet engaging way to browse celebrated works. 
                Each title is more than a point on a plot — it’s a gateway into new worlds and narratives.
                <br> <br>
                Beneath the surface, <i>On the Same Page</i> is powered by thoughtful data collection and preparation. 
                Additional layers of information — including book covers, publication years, and comprehensive author details — were gathered through custom scraping scripts. 
                This raw data was then processed, cleaned, and transformed using R, ensuring the final dataset was both accurate and optimized for visualization. 
                The result is a streamlined JSON file that fuels the scatterplot, updated most recently on March 12, 2023. 
                The project treats data not as static numbers, but as a flexible, evolving resource that shapes the user experience.
                <br><br>
                On the technical side, <i>On the Same Page</i> is built with Angular and brought to life through D3.js. This combination allows for smooth, responsive interactions — whether you're zooming in on a particular genre, filtering results by author, or simply hovering over a title for more information. It’s a balance of structure and motion — data not just displayed, but animated and interactive. 
                For those interested in the underlying code, the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/On-the-Same-Page/on-the-same-page.git"> <u>full project repository</u></a> offers an open view into the technical craftsmanship behind the scenes.
                <br><br>
                Yet, <i>On the Same Page</i> is more than its technology stack. It’s a story of collaboration — a process where design decisions stem from both creativity and logic. 
                It reflects the challenge of transforming raw data into something both functional and visually engaging. 
                Every visualization choice is rooted in domain knowledge, ensuring the interface remains both striking and usable. 
                At its core, the project is about making complexity approachable — turning layers of information into a clear, navigable experience for users.
                <br><br>
                This project also highlights key lessons learned: the importance of data fluency — the ability to clean, shape, and explore data efficiently. 
                The value of teamwork and open communication — where ideas are refined through shared expertise. And the guiding principle of data visualization: begin with an overview, enable zoom and filter options for deeper exploration, and reveal details only when the user seeks them. 
                Ultimately, it reinforces that great visualizations are not just about data — they are about how people interact with and interpret that data.
                <br><br>
                <i>On the Same Page</i> is not merely a visualization. 
                It’s an intersection of literature, design, and technology — a carefully crafted experience that turns data into discovery. 
                It invites you to explore its constellation of books — to navigate, to connect, and perhaps, to stumble upon your next great read, just a click away.</p>

                    <p>To further concretize the ideas generated from the brainstorming and the conceptualization phase, a more concrete sketch of the ideas was made. 
                        The sketching allowed for a more outlined idea, combining possible technologies with the concept of board games. 
                        In addition, sketches were made for more detailed aspects of the concept, for example the game pawns and playing board for the game. 
                        While the sketches for the playing board were mostly made on paper to visualize different aspects and attributes a playing board should have, the sketches for the game pawns were mostly digital and made in the 3D printing tools TinkerCad. 
                        This tool gives a 3D view of the model being sketched, and provides precise dimensions making them easily adjustable. This allowed us to try several shapes and sizes to find appropriate ones in regards to the technology used and the desired experience of the board game.

                        To easier describe the setup, the components will be called A and B. Camera A was connected to computer A, which, in turn, was connected to projector B using an HDMI cable.
                         Similarly, camera B was connected to computer B and projector A via an HDMI cable. Essentially, camera A captured the view from camera B through the projection from projector A, while camera B did the same with camera A's view. 
                         This configuration allowed for double projection to be achieved.
                        To prevent video looping, it was crucial to ensure that the cameras captured only the projection and nothing else. This requirement was successfully met by utilizing Logitech Capture, a software tool that facilitated control over the zoom and angle settings of the cameras. 
                        The cameras were placed on camera stands that were elevated to their maximum height which guaranteed complete coverage of the entire projection area. 
                        The projectors were utilized to project the camera view of the other person onto a table. To play the game, each person had their own set of pawns from a board game called Quarto. Additionally, one person had the game board placed on their table. 
                        We took the initiative to create custom pawns and a larger game board, ensuring that the setup was clearly visible through the camera and projector.
                        As previously mentioned, the objective of this project was to explore board games in a hybrid setup. However, for demonstration purposes of this prototype, we employed a direct connection between the computers and projectors of both users.
                        To simulate a hybrid setup, an artificial wall was used to separate the tables. 
                        Additionally, an iPad was positioned in the corner of each table, facilitating an ongoing FaceTime call. 
                        This arrangement was designed to optimize the telepresence experience, enabling users to engage in verbal communication, observe one another's facial expressions, and closely monitor hand and pawn movements during gameplay, all the while having tangible physical pawns that they can physically move themselves.
                        In the final demonstration of the prototype, we performed a live-on user evaluation, to understand users' experiences better and to gain feedback of the prototype for the final adjustments.
