              <p>In this project, we aimed to enrich the art appreciation of the Qingming Shanghe Tu (chinese: 清明上河图(圖), english: Along the River During the Qingming Festival)
                painting through multimodal perception by providing a sonic dimension to the visual illustration.The design was evaluated
                with user tests in two groups, i.e.,with and without sound interactions.The evaluation shows how the group with sound interactions
                could more accurately identify the depictions on the painting and spent more time in exploring the art piece.In addition, two themes 
                were identified from the qualitative questionnaires in the evaluation: a positive reception of the work and that sound enhances experience
                and interaction. We conclude that the project enhanced the emotional and aesthetic experience as well as improved the understanding of the artwork.
                By incorporating concepts from sound interaction in artwork, our research suggest a broader application for other art pieces, where
                sound interaction can be another way of understanding the interactive systems used in art pieces. Below is an outline of the design, process, 
                evaluation and materials to showcase the project.</p>
              <h2>Design</h2>
              <p>Due to the scroll painting having a very long horizontal dimension, the painting is interacted with in sections – similarly
                to how someone would read a scroll painting section wise. The user meets the very right end of the painting and
                is invited to interact with the touch screen, by scrolling horizontally to the left or using two fingers to zoom in or
                out in the painting. Certain parts of the painting are designed with a soundscape and to
                guide the user to these sections the parts in-between provide background music. This, in a sense, creates a rhythm
                between the music and soundscape parts where the music appears and ceases throughout the interaction. In the sections
                with the soundscapes, the user can hear the sounds from different levels – a zoomed out perspective creates an overall soundscape, 
                but as users zoom in from an overview to specific details, the sounds transition from an overhead urban
                soundscape to distinct street noises. The volume is also related to how close the user is to a detail, which continuously
                changes the soundscape as the user explore the painting.

                 <h2>DESIGNING PROCESS</h2>
                 <p>Since there are many versions of the Qingming scroll, choosing which version of the painting to use in the design of
                     the soundscape was one of the main design choices in the early designing stages. There were a couple of factors which
                     played a role in the selection. We needed a digital version, available to the public and with high resolution to support in-detail
                     zooming. Based on this, we develop two early-stage prototypes – one of the original version from Song dynasty, and the
                     other from the Qing dynasty. This project ended up choosing the version from the Qing dynasty, due to the feedback
                     we received after presenting the digital prototypes for a potential audience. <br><br>

                     To create the digital Qingming scroll, we utilized the game engine Unity for the construction and to add
                     functionalities like touch-controlled zoom and finger scrolling. Adobe Audition was used for arranging, altering, and
                     editing sounds with audio sourced from digital libraries or produced by ourselves. <br><br>
                      We used the three-dimensional
                     mode to be able to incorporate the three-dimensional soundscape. This project makes use of the game engine’s
                     three-dimensional
                     mode to create a
                     two-dimensional picture viewing system that
                     allows for the expansion and combination of
                     three-dimensional sounds. The sound system’s
                     production is divided into two parts:
                     background music and sound effects. This
                     project also divided the image into three categories,
                     rural, town, and palace, and customized
                     different background music to match the
                     various contents. The music function as a transition element
                     between the sections having a soundscape. When the user navigates to a
                     different area of painting, the collider is
                     triggered, changing the current sound. In terms
                     of sound effects, this project creates sound
                     effects that correspond to different story points
                     on the image. The size of the sound amplitude
                     is affected by the camera's distance from the
                     vertical direction of the image, and the
                     parameters of the sound phase are affected by
                     the camera's distance from the horizontal direction of the image. In this way, the sound
                     system can three-dimensional
                     be
                     used
                     space
                     to
                     and
                     simulate
                     generate
                     reasonable sound changes when scrolling and
                     zooming in and out of images to enhance the
                     interactive experience. The sound changes dynamically as the users are navigating the painting. In
                     total, seventy-four sound points were spread out in the painting to create an urban soundscape that aligns with the
                     painting’s narrative.</p>

                     <h2>EVALUATION</h2>
                     <p><br><br>EVALUATION METHOD <br>
                       The evaluation consisted of user tests with 14 participants divided into two groups: one with sound and one without.
                       The first group experienced the final design with sound interaction features, while the second group, the control group,
                       experienced it without sound. Both groups received the same instructions and completed the same tests, differing only
                       in the presence of sound. The participants were between 18-30 years old and of a range of cultural backgrounds– three
                       of the participants were of Chinese background to allow for a comparison of cultural experiences. The sound group
                       included eight participants, and the no-sound group included six. The tests utilized a Lenovo Yoga 7i screen touch
                       computer, enabling participants to scroll and zoom on the painting with their fingers. Sound was provided through
                       MARSHALLMajor IV Wireless On-Ear Headphones. To ensure consistency, the participants used the same display
                       and headphones, with a constant volume setting and control deactivated during the application run. The volume
                       was checked between the participants to maintain consistency. The evaluation was overseen by an observer and an
                       instructor for each test. The participants were instructed to familiarize themselves with the digital scroll painting and
                       were informed that there was no time limit for their exploration. However, the time duration was still documented, but
                       the participants could take their time in the exploration. Following this, the participants completed a questionnaire on a
                       separate electronic tablet about their experience of the interactive painting. Next, the participants were shown three
                       depictions of specific element from the painting (see Fig. 1) and were asked to provide their interpretations. Each of
                       these elements were associated with a representative sound in the sonified version of the digital scroll. The depicted
                       elements were a bank, people butchering a pig, and a street performance with a monkey. Finally, the participants
                       engaged in a timed task, which required them to locate a person falling to the ground somewhere in the scroll. The
                       time duration to identify this painting detail in this task was recorded. In the sonified version, the painting detail in the
                       tasks were accompanied with sound, unlike the group without sound.<br><br>
                       The collected data was both quantitative and qualitative. The quantitative data, i.e., the collected time duration for the
                       tasks, was analyzed through descriptive statistics and inferential analysis. The interpretation tasks were analyzed by proximity to the correct answer.
                       The qualitative data collected in the evaluation was analyzed thematically through coding and by identifying themes.                       
                       <br><br><br>
                       EVALUATION RESULT<br>
                       From the analysis we found that participants of the group who had the painting with sounds spent on average 1 minute
                       and 47 seconds longer exploring the painting, compared to the group without sound. However, the inferential analysis
                       could not indicate that sound would have a significant effect on the time spent for exploration. We could, however, see
                       that there was a trend in a longer time in the exploration of the painting when sound was present.<br><br>
                       In the interpretation tasks, the participants of the sound group consistently showed higher accuracy compared
                       to those in the no-sound group. In the first task (Fig. 1a), 87,5% of the sound group answered the questions using
                       keywords like bank, money, coins and such, compared to the no-sound group with a rate of 16.67%. All participants in
                       the sound-group interpreted Fig. 1b as butchering of an animal, whereas to the 33.33% in the no-sound group. The street
                       performance scene (Fig. 1c), 75% in the sound group used words like "monkey" or "circus", wherears only 16.67% mentioned
                       relevant descriptions in the no-sound group. These findings indicate how there is an advantage of sound interaction in
                       promoting a certain understanding and interpretation of certain elements.<br><br>
                       The results from the task of identifying a falling person did not show any big difference between the two group.
                       However, some participants expressed how the sound effects helped them to locate the person faster.<br><br>
                       From the qualitative analysis two themes were identified in the sound group – positive reception and sound enhances
                       experience and interaction – and one theme in the group without sound – positive experience of visuals (see Table 1).
                       Even though some codes used in the analysis may resemble similarities, it is important to understand the context in
                       which they were expressed in – the group which experience the digital scroll without any sound were more directed
                       towards the visual experience, while the group with sound mentioned both dimensions.
