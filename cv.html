                    <tr><td class="edu-dates"></td><td><i> AI imagery technologies (AI technologies for image-making) have rapidly advanced in generating content from language input, achieving big commercial growth. Being primarily developed in a western context and therefore risking the exclusion of non-dominant cultures, these technologies can impact both individuals and society. By including a range of cultural viewpoints, AI can avoid reinforcing dominant aesthetics and contribute to a more inclusive representation. This project incorporates cultural viewpoints through the Cultural Commentator Method. In this project, cultural commentators were then invited to semi-structured workshops discussing AI imagery technologies. This study reveals that the cultural commentators expressed concerns about AI’s inability to accurately represent local identities, highlighting instances where AI-generated images often depicted individuals with generic features, underlining the need for culturally nuanced design in AI imagery technologies. The study describes how perspectives from other cultural contexts can enhance inclusiveness in AI imagery technology design, and suggests future work by combining the Cultural Commentary Method with traditional user research to contribute to the 4th wave of HCI methods.

colors to emotions communicated through
music. The research question of the study is
How do people associate colors to emotions
expressed through music excerpts from the
Baroque period? This is important to
investigate because of the interest in
studying colors’ relation to emotions in
more dimensions, in particular, Baroque
music. An experiment was carried out where
subjects were asked to listen to music
excerpts and rate their association to color
and emotion. In addition, demographic data
was collected. Data was statistically
analyzed with descriptive statistics and
t-tests. The results indicate that some colors
had a stronger association to certain
emotions expressed through selected music
excerpts. The subjects associated each music
excerpt with the predefined emotion and the
association to happiness and anger was more
distinct than the association to calmness and
sadness. Connections between this study’s
result and previous findings in the field can
be distinguished.

                    <tr><td class="edu-dates"></td><td><i>The project examine the gender distribution within the grocery retail sector, using the Swedish chainstore ICA as a case study. We analyzed  the underlying reasons behind this distribution, particularly focusing on ICA's portrayal in advertisements as well as  the gender composition within two ICA Kvantum stores. Drawing on Acker's theories of inequality regimes, the analysis suggests that homosocial reproduction and gendered perceptions of leadership attributes contribute to the gender disparities observed. The study employs a qualitative methodology, combining interviews with literature review to gather insights into employees' experiences and organizational contexts. Findings reveal patterns of gendered roles and responsibilities within ICA, where men predominantly occupy hierarchical positions associated with traits traditionally deemed masculine. In addition, the introduction of ICA-Stina in the chainstore’s advertisements highlights organizational efforts towards gender diversity, albeit with mixed reactions from customers. The conclusion underscores the persistence of gendered norms and the need for nuanced approaches to promote inclusivity and challenge stereotypes within organizations like ICA.

                    <tr><td class="edu-dates"></td><td><i> The study explores why Apotea, an e-commerce pharmacy, shares similarities with traditional brick-and-mortar pharmacies despite operating solely online. It examines institutional isomorphism, focusing on coercive (legal and societal pressures), mimetic (imitating successful models), and normative (shared professional norms) forces. Apotea faces pressures from regulations like the Law on the Sale of Medicines and societal expectations. It strategically mimics traditional pharmacy structures and practices for legitimacy, leveraging expertise from successful e-commerce ventures like Adlibris. Additionally, shared professional norms and networks contribute to its conformity. This convergence enhances Apotea's legitimacy but constrains its flexibility.

                    <tr><td class="edu-dates"></td><td><i>The study investigates the challenges associated with merging university institutions, using the example of the Slavic, Baltic, Finnish, Dutch, and German Department (SlaBaFiNeTy) at Stockholm University. Through qualitative methods including interviews and a student survey, the study examines perceptions and difficulties encountered during the merger process. Drawing on Brown & Humphreys' framework, the analysis reveals key factors influencing the merger, such as differing narratives among stakeholders, resistance to change, and the importance of integration efforts. Employees from both merging departments initially had concerns and perceived challenges, reflecting a tragic narrative characterized by skepticism and frustration. However, efforts to integrate departments and foster a sense of community helped mitigate some of these challenges. Student perspectives also reflected concerns about potential negative impacts on personal interactions and teaching quality. The study concludes that successful institutional mergers require transparent communication, understanding of motives, and robust integration efforts to address resistance and foster a sense of unity. Overall, the analysis emphasizes the significance of human factors in navigating complex organizational changes within universities

                    <tr><td class="edu-dates"></td><td><i>The project delves into SHEIN's fast-fashion business model, assessing its environmental impact and the phenomenon of greenwashing. SHEIN's promotion of clothing overconsumption contributes to environmental degradation, posing image problems as consumers more and more prioritize sustainability. This analysis provides a breakdown of the organization's business model and proposes greenwashing activities for SHEIN’s particular business model, and uses it as a case to highlight tactics which organizations use to appear more sustainable. Utilizing the Business Model Canvas framework, the analysis covers SHEIN's key components, emphasizing its value proposition of trendy, affordable fashion primarily targeting Gen Z consumers. The company relies on direct sales channels and influencer partnerships for marketing, while customer relationships are managed through automated services. Revenue streams come from product sales and user fees, with a cost-driven model focusing on low prices and automation. However, the fast-fashion model raises environmental concerns due to overconsumption and planned obsolescence, potentially impacting SHEIN's image.To address image problems and align with sustainability trends, suggestions include pragmatic legitimacy strategies and communication measures. These include switching to biodegradable packaging, offering sustainable shipping options, and launching a marketing campaign highlighting sustainability initiatives, while keeping the product development chain the same. Implementing these measures could strengthen SHEIN's image, but failure to uphold sustainability efforts may in-turn lead to negative consequences. Greenwashing undermines genuine sustainability efforts and risks consumer trust. In conclusion, while greenwashing may temporarily bolster a company's image, it poses risks and challenges. The responsibility for sustainability lies with both consumers and companies, with transparency and genuine efforts becoming increasingly important as societal awareness grows.

Virtue Hair is a business idea aimed at transforming the haircutting industry through the utilization of 3D modeling technology to visualize various hairstyles and cater to the specific preferences of hairstylists’ clients. The target demographic primarily consists of haircutting establishments of medium to high quality, with limited interest anticipated from lower-quality shops. To validate the concept and align it with customer expectations, comprehensive market analysis and validation efforts, including prototype development, have been undertaken. The idea was developed in National Taiwan University, including a proof-of-concept on the Taiwanese market. These initiatives refined the business concept and demonstrated its potential to change the haircutting service industry. The business idea progress was continuously evaluated by peers, working professionals and investors, through weekly pitches and demonstrations.
