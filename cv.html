Virtue Hair is a business idea aimed at transforming the haircutting industry through the utilization of 3D modeling technology to visualize various hairstyles and cater to the specific preferences of hairstylists’ clients. The target demographic primarily consists of haircutting establishments of medium to high quality, with limited interest anticipated from lower-quality shops. To validate the concept and align it with customer expectations, comprehensive market analysis and validation efforts, including prototype development, have been undertaken. The idea was developed in National Taiwan University, including a proof-of-concept on the Taiwanese market. These initiatives refined the business concept and demonstrated its potential to change the haircutting service industry. The business idea progress was continuously evaluated by peers, working professionals and investors, through weekly pitches and demonstrations.

Stakeholder requirements (STK), non-functional requirements (NFR), and functional requirements (USE) for business functions and objectives were documented in each iteration. The project involved the creation and management of requirements documents based on developed business descriptions and objectives. The project was assessed based on the quality of the requirements documents, the utilization of requirements attributes and traceability, and their alignment and completeness with the business case and objectives. The requirements management tool, based on Microsoft Access, was utilized for managing and tracking requirements, as well as generating Traceability Matrix. Furthermore, MS Word documents were employed to complement the requirements management tool by incorporating additional information, tables, and models to enhance the overall clarity and understanding of the project deliverables.

It involves understanding fundamental concepts such as identifiers, keys, and relationships within a database context. The primary task is to translate a given conceptual model into a logical relational database model using Microsoft Access. Once the logical model is established, the next step is to implement it within the Access database management system. This implementation process ensures that the database accurately reflects the logical model, maintaining data integrity and completeness throughout. Additionally, the database is populated with test data to facilitate validation checks.Furthermore, the project includes the construction of SQL queries to interact with the database, allowing for data retrieval and manipulation</td></tr>

By answering a range of questions using SQL and relational algebra against a predefined database model, necessary data could be extracted from the database. The project allowed for practical experience in querying databases using SQL and relational algebra, enhancing understanding of database concepts and query languages.</td></tr>
