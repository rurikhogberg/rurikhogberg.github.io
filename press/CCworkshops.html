            <h1>Workshop Series on AI Imagery Technologies with Cultural Commentators </h1>

                In order to better understand the current development of AI technologies, and be able to contribute to a more human-centered development and design of the technologies,
                RURIK explored the usage of the Cultural Commentary method, previously used in Interaction Design and Human-Computer Interaction, and it's potential in designing Human-AI interaction. 
                Using Cultural Commentators as an evaluation method of a design, technology, or a concept, can provide with new insight for the designer in the evaluation process by exposing new angles outside of the designer's typical scope of expertise or cultural exposure.
                Since the rapid development of Human-AI interaction, it is of high interest to find more ways to evaluate the interaction. Here, the application of user interaction methods can open up for new possibilities in the evaluation stage in the design process.
                <br>
<br>
A workshop series was organized, inviting commentators to discuss and explore the emerging AI image technologies. 6 commentators participated in 2-3 hour long workshop sessions, where the cultural commentators could explore, learn and provide their reflections. 
The sessions combined structured activities with open discussion. Participants were introduced to the project and then invited to evaluate AI-generated image prompts, engage hands-on with a AI image generation tool, and reflect on the implications of AI imagery from the point-of-view of their professional expertise. 
A final discussion was guided by prepared questions designed to spark deeper commentary. 
To encourage authentic responses, participants were also given time for individual reflection, with the option to submit additional insights after the session.
<br><br>
RURIK’s role included designing the workshop structure, moderating the discussions, and ensuring the sessions ran smoothly within a limited timeframe. 
His facilitation helped create an open, reflective environment where participants could comfortably share their thoughts and critiques—laying the groundwork for exploring the application of this method and its potential contributions in Human-AI interaction.
<br><br>
A sincere thank you to all of the commentators participating in the workshop sessions, contributing with reflection, feedback and personal and professional insight to this reseearch project. Your time, efforts and engagement has been invaluable.
